You are reading what we hope will become an important and, potentially revolutionary, new academic journal. Not only is it peer-reviewed and open access, like all QScience.com journals, it is also unique in its scope, as it intends to publish research in all fields from architecture to zoology. A full list of subject areas can be found on the journal website.

Our only criteria for acceptance in the journal is that the presented work be original and has been performed to the standards and practices normal to that field. We do not ask our reviewers to judge the perceived interest in the work, or the scale of the advancement. We just check to make sure it is valid, ethical and correct.

It is more important to us to have the readers determine the interest and usefulness of an article. Each article shows the number of downloads it has attracted, as well as allowing readers to leave comments on each article. When an article is cited by another article, the citing article information is displayed alongside the original.

Much of the research carried out in today’s environments is multidisciplinary in nature, and we hope that some of this work will find a home in the journal.

We are also extending and developing the concept of an article and will happily consider audio and video files as manuscripts, provided a text abstract is also supplied. This is important for fields which may not have previously considered ‘publishing’ their work in an academic journal before now.

As with all our journals, abstracts will be translated in Arabic and the author will retain copyright of their work through a Creative Commons Attribution license (CC BY 3.0)1

We hope that this fresh approach to journal publishing will open up a fascinating world of academic research to our readers.
