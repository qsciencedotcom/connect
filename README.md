This is an experiment is scientific communication which we think mirrors the way science happens in the real world.
Previous work is built on, incremently, over time. Having seen the success of this approach for code on github, we decided to try the same thing with scientific papers.

We have provided the xml file of each article in this repository. Each file also has a DOI link to the original html and pdf on the QScience.com website. This may prove useful if something is missing/wrong/confusing in the xml (even though it is NLM DTD compliant).

We hope to add simple html versions soon too.

In the meantime, enjoy.
