This is an experiment is scientific communication which we think mirrors the way science happens in the real world.
Previous work is built on, incremently, over time. Having seen the success of this approach for code on github, we decided to try the same thing with scientific papers.

Where possible, we have made the papers available in plain text. Clearly this is not going to cover everything (such as figures and tables). Each text file therefore has a DOI link to the original html and pdf on the QScience.com website.

Mathematical equations will be transformed into tex where possible.
Chemical reactions, depending on their complexity, may be rendered as text. However it is always a good idea to refer to the original text versions if in doubt, or a figure is missing from the plain text file.

If anyone wants to help us with any of the above limitations, I'll be very happy to hear from you.

In the meantime, enjoy.
